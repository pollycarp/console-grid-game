# Console-Based Grid Adventure Game

## Overview
This is a Python-based console game developed as part of the **Computing 2** coursework assignment. The game places a player on a 20x20 grid, represented by `#`, and challenges them to navigate toward a goal `G` while avoiding randomly placed enemies `E`. The player must manage their health, which decreases with movement and enemy encounters.
